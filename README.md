# s3tohtml
A php server to allow browsing of an AWS S3 bucket via web browser

## Why do we need this ?
If you have an S3 bucket with files inside.  For example a dumping area for HTML reports from an automated program, then this will allow you to browse and view them.
Would you not just use the built in S3 web site browser ?
